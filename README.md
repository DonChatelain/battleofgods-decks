# Battle of Gods: Deck Manager

Battle of Gods is a physical board game current in development and led by Don Chatelain and Patrick Johnson. With revisions being constantly made to cards and characters and game rules, and to mitigate unnecessary printing and reprinting of cards as changes are made, I decided to build a mobile app for my partners and the beta-testers play-testing the game. Below serves as a description of technologies used and decisions made.

* Built with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/) - which is essentially Cordova with Angular components helping achieve a true native app feel- in both style and functionality. This allows for easy building and deployment to both an iOS and Android application- using a single code base. Neato!
